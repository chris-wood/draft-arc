                       draft-yun-cfrg-arc-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies the Anonymous Rate-Limited Credential (ARC)
   protocol, a specialization of keyed-verification anonymous
   credentials with support for rate limiting.  ARC credentials can be
   presented from client to server up to some fixed number of times,
   where each presentation is cryptographically bound to client secrets
   and application-specific public information, such that each
   presentation is unlinkable from the others as well as the original
   credential creation.  ARC is useful in applications where a server
   needs to throttle or rate-limit access from anonymous clients.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the Anonymous Rate-Limited Credential (ARC)
   protocol, a specialization of keyed-verification anonymous
   credentials with support for rate limiting.

   ARC is privately verifiable (keyed-verification), yet differs from
   similar token-based protocols in that each credential can be
   presented multiple times without violating unlinkability of different
   presentations.  Servers issue credentials to clients that are
   cryptographically bound to client secrets and some public
   information.  Afterwards, clients can present this credential to the
   server up to some fixed number of times, where each presentation
   provides proof that it was derived from a valid (previously issued)
   credential and bound to some public information.  Each presentation
   is pairwise unlinkable, meaning the server cannot link any two
   presentations to the same client credential, nor can the server link
   a presentation to the preceding credential issuance flow.  Notably,
   the maximum number of presentations from a credential is fixed by the
   application.

   ARC is useful in settings where applications require a fixed number
   of zero-knowledge proofs about client secrets that can also be
   cryptographically bound to some public information.  This capability
   lets servers use credentials in applications that need throttled or
   rate-limited access from anonymous clients.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

2.1.  Notation and Terminology

   The following functions and notation are used throughout the
   document.

   *  concat(x0, ..., xN): Concatenation of byte strings.  For example,
      concat(0x01, 0x0203, 0x040506) = 0x010203040506.

   *  bytes_to_int and int_to_bytes: Convert a byte string to and from a
      non-negative integer. bytes_to_int and int_to_bytes are
      implemented as OS2IP and I2OSP as described in [RFC8017],
      respectively.  Note that these functions operate on byte strings
      in big-endian byte order.

   *  random_integer_uniform(M, N): Generate a random, uniformly
      distributed integer R between M inclusive and N exclusive, i.e., M
      <= R < N.

   *  random_integer_uniform_excluding_set(M, N, S): Generate a random,
      uniformly distributed integer R between M inclusive and N
      exclusive, i.e., M <= R < N, such that R does not exist in the set
      of integers S.

   All algorithms and procedures described in this document are laid out
   in a Python-like pseudocode.  Each function takes a set of inputs and
   parameters and produces a set of output values.  Parameters become
   constant values once the protocol variant and the ciphersuite are
   fixed.

   The notation T U[N] refers to an array called U containing N items of
   type T.  The type opaque means one single byte of uninterpreted data.
   Items of the array are zero-indexed and referred as U[j] such that 0
   <= j < N.  The notation {T} refers to a set consisting of elements of
   type T.  For any object x, we write len(x) to denote its length in
   bytes.

   String values such as "CredentialRequest", "CredentialResponse",
   "Presentation", and "Tag" are ASCII string literals.

   The following terms are used throughout this document.

   *  Client: Protocol initiator.  Creates a credential request, and
      uses the corresponding server response to make a credential.  The
      client can make multiple presentations of this credential.

   *  Server: Computes a response to a credential request, with its
      server private keys.  Later the server can verify the client's
      presentations with its private keys.  Learns nothing about the
      client's secret attributes, and cannot link a client's request/
      response and presentation steps.

3.  Preliminaries

   The construction in this document has one primary dependency:

   *  Group: A prime-order group implementing the API described below in
      Section 3.1.  See Section 6 for specific instances of groups.

3.1.  Prime-Order Group

   In this document, we assume the construction of an additive, prime-
   order group Group for performing all mathematical operations.  In
   prime-order groups, any element (other than the identity) can
   generate the other elements of the group.  Usually, one element is
   fixed and defined as the group generator.  In the ARC setting, there
   are two fixed generator elements (generatorG, generatorH).  Such
   groups are uniquely determined by the choice of the prime p that
   defines the order of the group.  (There may, however, exist different
   representations of the group for a single p.  Section 6 lists
   specific groups which indicate both order and representation.)

   The fundamental group operation is addition + with identity element
   I.  For any elements A and B of the group, A + B = B + A is also a
   member of the group.  Also, for any A in the group, there exists an
   element -A such that A + (-A) = (-A) + A = I.  Scalar multiplication
   by r is equivalent to the repeated application of the group operation
   on an element A with itself r-1 times, this is denoted as r*A = A +
   ... + A.  For any element A, p*A=I.  The case when the scalar
   multiplication is performed on the group generator is denoted as
   ScalarMultGen(r).  Given two elements A and B, the discrete logarithm
   problem is to find an integer k such that B = k*A.  Thus, k is the
   discrete logarithm of B with respect to the base A.  The set of
   scalars corresponds to GF(p), a prime field of order p, and are
   represented as the set of integers defined by {0, 1, ..., p-1}. This
   document uses types Element and Scalar to denote elements of the
   group and its set of scalars, respectively.

   We now detail a number of member functions that can be invoked on a
   prime-order group.

   *  Order(): Outputs the order of the group (i.e. p).

   *  Identity(): Outputs the identity element of the group (i.e. I).

   *  Generator(): Outputs the fixed generator of the group.

   *  HashToGroup(x, info): Deterministically maps an array of bytes x
      with domain separation value info to an element of Group.  The map
      must ensure that, for any adversary receiving R = HashToGroup(x,
      info), it is computationally difficult to reverse the mapping.
      Security properties of this function are described in
      [I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve].

   *  HashToScalar(x, info): Deterministically maps an array of bytes x
      with domain separation value info to an element in GF(p).
      Security properties of this function are described in
      [I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve], Section 10.5.

   *  RandomScalar(): Chooses at random a non-zero element in GF(p).

   *  ScalarInverse(s): Returns the inverse of input Scalar s on GF(p).

   *  SerializeElement(A): Maps an Element A to a canonical byte array
      buf of fixed length Ne.

   *  DeserializeElement(buf): Attempts to map a byte array buf to an
      Element A, and fails if the input is not the valid canonical byte
      representation of an element of the group.  This function can
      raise a DeserializeError if deserialization fails or A is the
      identity element of the group; see Section 6 for group-specific
      input validation steps.

   *  SerializeScalar(s): Maps a Scalar s to a canonical byte array buf
      of fixed length Ns.

   *  DeserializeScalar(buf): Attempts to map a byte array buf to a
      Scalar s.  This function can raise a DeserializeError if
      deserialization fails; see Section 6 for group-specific input
      validation steps.

   For each group, there exists two distinct generators, generatorG and
   generatorH, generatorG = G.Generator() and generatorH =
   G.HashToGroup(G.SerializeElement(generatorG), "generatorH").  The
   group member functions GeneratorG() and GeneratorH() are shorthand
   for returning generatorG and generatorH, respectively.

   Section 6 contains details for the implementation of this interface
   for different prime-order groups instantiated over elliptic curves.

4.  ARC Protocol

   The ARC protocol is a two-party protocol run between client and
   server consisting of three distinct phases:

   1.  Key generation.  In this phase, the server generates its private
       and public keys to be used for the remaining phases.  This phase
       is described in Section 4.1.

   2.  Credential issuance.  In this phase, the client and server
       interact to issue the client a credential that is
       cryptographically bound to client secrets.  This phase is
       described in Section 4.2.

   3.  Presentation.  In this phase, the client uses the credential to
       create a "presentation" to the server, where the server learns
       nothing more than whether or not the presentation is valid and
       corresponds to some previously issued credential, without
       learning which credential it corresponds to.  This phase is
       described in Section 4.3.

   This protocol bears resemblance to anonymous token protocols, such as
   those built on Blind RSA [BLIND-RSA] and Oblivious Pseudorandom
   Functions [OPRFS] with one critical distinction: unlike anonymous
   tokens, an anonymous credential can be used multiple times to create
   unlinkable presentations (up to the fixed presentation limit).  This
   means that a single issuance invocation can drive multiple
   presentation invocations, whereas with anonymous tokens, each
   presentation invocation requires exactly one issuance invocation.  As
   a result, credentials are generally longer lived than tokens.
   Applications configure the credential presentation limit after the
   credential is issued such that client and server agree on the limit
   during presentation.  Servers are responsible for ensuring this limit
   is not exceeded.  Clients that exceed the agreed-upon presentation
   limit break the unlinkability guarantees provided by the protocol.

   The rest of this section describes the three phases of the ARC
   protocol.

4.1.  Key Generation

   In the key generation phase, the server generates its private and
   public keys, denoted ServerPrivateKey and ServerPublicKey, as
   follows.

Input: None
Output:
- ServerPrivateKey:
  - x0: Scalar
  - x1: Scalar
  - x2: Scalar
  - x0Blinding: Scalar
- ServerPublicKey:
  - X0: Element
  - X1: Element
  - X2: Element

Parameters
- Group G

def SetupServer():
  x0 = G.RandomScalar()
  x1 = G.RandomScalar()
  x2 = G.RandomScalar()
  x0Blinding = G.RandomScalar()
  X0 = x0 * G.GeneratorG() + x0Blinding * G.GeneratorH()
  X1 = x1 * G.GeneratorH()
  X2 = x2 * G.GeneratorH()
  return ServerPrivateKey(x0, x1, x2, x0Blinding), ServerPublicKey(X0, X1, X2)

   The server public keys can be serialized as follows:

   struct {
     uint8 X0[Ne]; // G.SerializeElement(X0)
     uint8 X1[Ne]; // G.SerializeElement(X1)
     uint8 X2[Ne]; // G.SerializeElement(X2)
   } ServerPublicKey;

   The length of this encoded response structure is NserverPublicKey =
   3*Ne.

4.2.  Issuance

   The purpose of the issuance phase is for the client and server to
   cooperatively compute a credential that is cryptographically bound to
   the client's secrets.  Clients do not choose these secrets; they are
   computed by the protocol.

   The issuance phase of the protocol requires clients to know the
   server public key a priori, as well as an arbitrary, application-
   specific request context.  It requires no other input.  It consists
   of three distinct steps:

   1.  The client generates and sends a credential request to the
       server.  This credential request contains a proof that the
       request is valid with respect to the client's secrets and request
       context.  See Section 4.2.1 for details about this step.

   2.  The server validates the credential request.  If valid, it
       computes a credential response with the server private keys.  The
       response includes a proof that the credential response is valid
       with respect to the server keys.  The server sends the response
       to the client.  See Section 4.2.2 for details about this step.

   3.  The client finalizes the credential by processing the server
       response.  If valid, this step yields a credential that can then
       be used in the presentation phase of the protocol.  See
       Section 4.2.3 for details about this step.

   Each of these steps are described in the following subsections.

4.2.1.  Credential Request

   Given a request context, the process for creating a credential
   request is as follows:

(clientSecrets, request) = CredentialRequest(requestContext)

Inputs:
- requestContext: Data, context for the credential request

Outputs:
- request:
  - m1Enc: Element, first encrypted secret.
  - m2Enc: Element, second encrypted secret.
  - requestProof: ZKProof, a proof of correct generation of m1Enc and m2Enc.
- clientSecrets:
  - m1: Scalar, first secret.
  - m2: Scalar, second secret.
  - r1: Scalar, blinding factor for first secret.
  - r2: Scalar, blinding factor for second secret.

Parameters:
- G: Group
- generatorG: Element, equivalent to G.GeneratorG()
- generatorH: Element, equivalent to G.GeneratorH()

def CredentialRequest(requestContext):
  m1 = G.RandomScalar()
  m2 = G.HashToScalar(requestContext, "requestContext")
  r1 = G.RandomScalar()
  r2 = G.RandomScalar()
  m1Enc = m1 * generatorG + r1 * generatorH
  m2Enc = m2 * generatorG + r2 * generatorH
  requestProof = MakeCredentialRequestProof(m1, m2, r1, r2, m1Enc, m2Enc)
  request = (m1Enc, m2Enc, requestProof)
  clientSecrets = (m1, m2, r1, r2)
  return (clientSecrets, request)

   See Section 5.2 for more details on the generation of the credential
   request proof.

   The resulting request can be serialized as follows.

   struct {
     uint8 m1Enc[Ne];
     uint8 m2Enc[Ne];
     uint8 challenge[Ns];
     uint8 response0[Ns];
     uint8 response1[Ns];
     uint8 response2[Ns];
     uint8 response3[Ns];
   } CredentialRequest;

   The length of this encoded request structure is Nrequest = 2*Ne +
   5*Ns.

4.2.2.  Credential Response

   Given a credential request and server public and private keys, the
   process for creating a credential response is as follows.

   response = CredentialResponse(serverPrivateKey, serverPublicKey, request)

   Inputs:
   - serverPrivateKey:
     - x0: Scalar (private), server private key 0.
     - x1: Scalar (private), server private key 1.
     - x2: Scalar (private), server private key 2.
     - x0Blinding: Scalar (private), blinding value for x0.
   - serverPublicKey:
     - X0: Element, server public key 0.
     - X1: Element, server public key 1.
     - X2: Element, server public key 2.
   - request:
     - m1Enc: Element, first encrypted secret.
     - m2Enc: Element, second encrypted secret.
     - requestProof: ZKProof, a proof of correct generation of m1Enc and m2Enc.

   Outputs:
   - U: Element, a randomized generator for the response, `b*G`.
   - encUPrime: Element, encrypted UPrime.
   - X0Aux: Element, auxiliary point for X0.
   - X1Aux: Element, auxiliary point for X1.
   - X2Aux: Element, auxiliary point for X2.
   - HAux: Element, auxiliary point for generatorH.
   - responseProof: ZKProof, a proof of correct generation of
     U, encUPrime, server public keys, and auxiliary points.

   Parameters:
   - G: Group
   - generatorG: Element, equivalent to G.GeneratorG()
   - generatorH: Element, equivalent to G.GeneratorH()

   Exceptions:
   - VerifyError, raised when response verification fails

   def CredentialResponse(serverPrivateKeys, serverPublicKey, request):
     if VerifyCredentialRequestProof(request) == false:
       raise VerifyError

     b = G.RandomScalar()
     U = b * generatorG
     encUPrime = b * (serverPublicKey.X0 +
           serverPrivateKeys.x1 * request.m1Enc +
           serverPrivateKeys.x2 * request.m2Enc)
     X0Aux = b * serverPrivateKeys.x0Blinding * generatorH
     X1Aux = b * serverPublicKey.X1
     X2Aux = b * serverPublicKey.X2
     HAux = b * generatorH

     responseProof = MakeCredentialResponseProof(serverPrivateKey,
       serverPublicKey, request, b, U, encUPrime, X0Aux, X1Aux, X2Aux, HAux)
     return (U, encUPrime, X0Aux, X1Aux, X2Aux, HAux, responseProof)

   The resulting response can be serialized as follows.  See Section 5.3
   for more details on the generation of the credential response proof.

   struct {
     uint8 U[Ne];
     uint8 encUPrime[Ne];
     uint8 X0Aux[Ne];
     uint8 X1Aux[Ne];
     uint8 X2Aux[Ne];
     uint8 HAux[Ne];
     uint8 challenge[Ns];
     uint8 response0[Ns];
     uint8 response1[Ns];
     uint8 response2[Ns];
     uint8 response3[Ns];
     uint8 response4[Ns];
     uint8 response5[Ns];
     uint8 response6[Ns];
   } CredentialResponse

   The length of this encoded response structure is Nresponse = 6*Ne +
   8*Ns.

4.2.3.  Finalize Credential

   Given a credential request and response, server public keys, and the
   client secrets produced when creating a credential request, the
   process for finalizing the issuance flow and creating a credential is
   as follows.

credential = FinalizeCredential(clientSecrets, serverPublicKey, request, response)

Inputs:
- clientSecrets:
  - m1: Scalar, first secret.
  - m2: Scalar, second secret.
  - r1: Scalar, blinding factor for first secret.
  - r2: Scalar, blinding factor for second secret.
- serverPublicKey: ServerPublicKey, shared with the client out-of-band
- request:
  - m1Enc: Element, first encrypted secret.
  - m2Enc: Element, second encrypted secret.
  - requestProof: ZKProof, a proof of correct generation of m1Enc and m2Enc.
- response:
  - U: Element, a randomized generator for the response. `b*G`.
  - encUPrime: Element, encrypted UPrime.
  - X0Aux: Element, auxiliary point for X0.
  - X1Aux: Element, auxiliary point for X1.
  - X2Aux: Element, auxiliary point for X2.
  - HAux: Element, auxiliary point for generatorH.
  - responseProof: ZKProof, a proof of correct generation of U, encUPrime, server public keys, and auxiliary points.

Outputs:
- credential:
  - m1: Scalar, client's first secret.
  - U: Element, a randomized generator for the response. `b*G`.
  - UPrime: Element, the MAC over the server's private keys and the client's secret secrets.
  - X1: Element, server public key 1.

Exceptions:
- VerifyError, raised when response verification fails

Parameters:
- G: Group
- generatorG: Element, equivalent to G.GeneratorG()
- generatorH: Element, equivalent to G.GeneratorH()

def FinalizeCredential(clientSecrets, serverPublicKey, request, response):
  if VerifyCredentialResponseProof(serverPublicKey, response, request) == false:
    raise VerifyError
  UPrime = response.encUPrime - response.X0Aux - clientSecrets.r1 * response.X1Aux - clientSecrets.r2 * response.X2Aux
  return (clientSecrets.m1, response.U, UPrime, serverPublicKey.X1)

4.3.  Presentation

   The purpose of the presentation phase is for the client to create a
   "presentation" to the server which can be verified using the server
   private key.  This phase is non-interactive, i.e., there is no state
   stored between client and server in order to produce and then verify
   a presentation.  Client and server agree upon a fixed limit of
   presentations in order to create and verify presentations;
   presentations will not verify correctly if the client and server use
   different limits.

   This phase consists of three steps:

   1.  The client creates a presentation state for a given presentation
       context and presentation limit.  This state is used to produce a
       fixed amount of presentations.

   2.  The client creates a presentation from the presentation state and
       sends it to the server.  The presentation is cryptographically
       bound to the state's presentation context, and contains proof
       that the presentation is valid with respect to the presentation
       context.  Moreover, the presentation contains proof that the
       nonce (an integer) associated with this presentation is within
       the presentation limit.

   3.  The server verifies the presentation with respect to the
       presentation context and presentation limit.

   Details for each each of these steps are in the following
   subsections.

4.3.1.  Presentation State

   Presentation state is used to track the number of presentations for a
   given credential.  This state is important for ARC's unlinkability
   goals: reuse of state can break unlinkability properties of
   credential presentations.  State is initialized with a credential,
   presentation context, and presentation limit.  It is then mutated
   after each presentation construction (as described in Section 4.3.2).

state = MakePresentationState(credential, presentationContext, presentationLimit)

Inputs:
- credential:
  - m1: Scalar, client's first secret.
  - U: Element, a randomized generator for the response `b*G`.
  - UPrime: Element, the MAC over the server's private keys and the client's secrets.

  return PresentationState(credential, presentationContext, [nonce], presentationLimit)

4.3.2.  Presentation Construction

   Creating a presentation requires a credential, presentation context,
   and presentation limit.  This process is necessarily stateful on the
   client since the number of times a credential is used for a given
   presentation context cannot exceed the presentation limit; doing so
   would break presentation unlinkability, as two presentations created
   with the same nonce can be directly compared for equality (via the
   "tag").  As a result, the process for creating a presentation accepts
   as input a presentation state and then outputs an updated
   presentation state.

newState, nonce, presentation = Present(state)

Inputs:
state: input PresentationState
  - credential
  - presentationContext: Data (public), used for presentation tag computation.
  - presentationNonceSet: {Integer}, the set of nonces that have been used for this presentation
  - presentationLimit: Integer, the fixed presentation limit.

Outputs:
- newState: updated PresentationState
- nonce: Integer, the nonce associated with this presentation.
- presentation:
  - U: Element, re-randomized from the U in the response.
  - UPrimeCommit: Element, a public key to the issued UPrime.
  - m1Commit: Element, a public key to the client secret (m1).
  - tag: Element, the tag element used for enforcing the presentation limit.
  - presentationProof: ZKProof, a proof of correct generation of the presentation.

Parameters:
- G: Group
- generatorG: Element, equivalent to G.GeneratorG()
- generatorH: Element, equivalent to G.GeneratorH()

Exceptions:
- LimitExceededError, raised when the presentation count meets or exceeds the presentation limit for the given presentation context

def Present(state):
  if len(state.presentationNonceSet) >= state.presentationLimit:
    raise LimitExceededError

  a = G.RandomScalar()
  r = G.RandomScalar()
  z = G.RandomScalar()

  U = a * state.credential.U
  UPrime = a * state.credential.UPrime
  UPrimeCommit = UPrime + r * generatorG
  m1Commit = state.credential.m1 * U + z * generatorH

  # This step mutates the state by keeping track of
  # what nonces have already been spent.
  nonce = random_integer_uniform_excluding_set(0,
    state.presentationLimit, state.presentationNonceSet)
  state.presentationNonceSet.add(nonce)

  generatorT = G.HashToGroup(presentationContext, "Tag")
  tag = (credential.m1 + nonce)^(-1) * generatorT
  V = z * credential.X1 - r * generatorG
  m1Tag = state.credential.m1 * tag

  presentationProof = MakePresentationProof(U, UPrimeCommit, m1Commit, tag, generatorT, credential, V, r, z, nonce, m1Tag)

  presentation = (U, UPrimeCommit, m1Commit, tag, presentationProof)

  return state, nonce, presentation

   [[OPEN ISSUE: should the tag also fold in the presentation limit?]]

   The resulting presentation can be serialized as follows.  See
   Section 5.4 for more details on the generation of the presentation
   proof.

   struct {
     uint8 U[Ne];
     uint8 UPrimeCommit[Ne];
     uint8 m1Commit[Ne];
     uint8 tag[Ne];
     uint8 challenge[Ns];
     uint8 response0[Ns];
     uint8 response1[Ns];
     uint8 response2[Ns];
     uint8 response3[Ns];
   } Presentation

   The length of this structure is Npresentation = 4*Ne + 5*Ns.

4.3.3.  Presentation Verification

   The server processes the presentation by verifying the presentation
   proof against server-computed values, and performing a check that the
   presentation conforms to the presentation limit.

validity = VerifyPresentation(serverPrivateKey, serverPublicKey, requestContext, presentationContext, nonce, presentation, presentationLimit)

Inputs:
- serverPrivateKey:
  - x0: Scalar (private), server private key 0.
  - x1: Scalar (private), server private key 1.
  - x2: Scalar (private), server private key 2.
  - x0Blinding: Scalar (private), blinding value for x0.
- serverPublicKey:
  - X0: Element, server public key 0.
  - X1: Element, server public key 1.
  - X2: Element, server public key 2.
- requestContext: Data, context for the credential request.
- presentationContext: Data (public), used for presentation tag computation.
- nonce: Integer, the nonce associated with this presentation.
- presentation:
  - U: Element, re-randomized from the U in the response.
  - UPrimeCommit: Element, a public key to the issued UPrime.
  - m1Commit: Element, a public key to the client secret (m1).
  - tag: Element, the tag element used for enforcing the presentation limit.
  - presentationProof: ZKProof, a proof of correct generation of the presentation.
- presentationLimit: Integer, the fixed presentation limit.

Outputs:
- validity: Boolean, True if the presentation is valid, False otherwise.

Parameters:
- G: Group
- generatorG: Element, equivalent to G.GeneratorG()
- generatorH: Element, equivalent to G.GeneratorH()

Exceptions:
- InvalidNonceError, raised when the nonce associated with the presentation is invalid

def VerifyPresentation(serverPrivateKey, serverPublicKey, requestContext, presentationContext, nonce, presentation, presentationLimit):
  if nonce < 0 or nonce > presentationLimit:
    raise InvalidNonceError

  generatorT = G.HashToGroup(presentationContext, "Tag")
  m1Tag = generatorT - (nonce * presentation.tag)

  validity = VerifyPresentationProof(serverPrivateKey, serverPublicKey, requestContext, presentationContext, presentation, m1Tag)
  # Implementation-specific step: perform double-spending check on tag.
  # Implementation-specific step: store tag for future double-spending check.
  return validity

   Implementation-specific steps: the server must perform a check that
   the tag (presentation.tag) has not previously been seen, to prevent
   double spending.  It then stores the tag for use in future double
   spending checks.  To reduce the overhead of performing double spend
   checks, the server can store and look up the tags corresponding to
   the associated requestContext and presentationContext values.

5.  Zero-Knowledge Proofs

   This section describes a Schnorr proof compiler that is used for the
   construction of other proofs needed throughout the ARC protocol.
   Section 5.1 describes the compiler, and the remaining sections
   describe how it is used for the purposes of producing ARC proofs.

5.1.  Schnorr Compiler

   The compiler specified in this section automates the Fiat-Shamir
   transform that is often used to transform interactive zero-knowledge
   proofs into non-interactive proofs such that they can be used to non-
   interactively prove various statements of importance in higher-level
   protocols, such as ARC.  The compiler consists of a prover and
   verifier role.  The prover constructs a transcript for the proof and
   then applies the Fiat-Shamir heuristic to generate the resulting
   challenge and response values.  The verifier reconstructs the same
   transcript to verify the proof.

   The prover and verifier roles are specified below in Section 5.1.1
   and Section 5.1.2, respectively.

5.1.1.  Prover

   The prover role consists of four functions:

   *  AppendScalar: This function adds a scalar representation to the
      transcript.

   *  AppendElement: This function adds an element representation to the
      transcript.

   *  Constrain: This function applies an explicit constraint to the
      proof, where the constraint is expressed as equality between some
      element and a linear combination of scalar and element
      representations.  An example constraint might be Z = aX + bY, for
      scalars a, b, and elements X, Y, Z.

   *  Prove: This function applies the Fiat-Shamir heuristic to the
      protocol transcript and set of constraints to produce a zero-
      knowledge proof that can be verified.

   These functions are defined in the following sub-sections.

   In addition, the prover role consists of the following state:

   *  label: Data, a value representing the context in which the proof
      will be used

   *  scalars: [Integer], An ordered set of representation of scalar
      variables to use in the proof.  Each scalar has a label associated
      with it, stored in a list called scalar_labels.

   *  elements: [Integer], An ordered set of representation of element
      variables to use in the proof.  Each element has a label
      associated with it, stored in a list called element_labels.

   *  constraints: a set of constraints, where each constraint consists
      of a constraint element and a linear combination of variables.

   Inputs:
   - label: Data, Scalar variable label

    serialized_blinded_element = G.SerializeElement(blinded_element)
    challenge_input += I2OSP(len(serialized_blinded_element), 2) + serialized_blinded_element

  return G.HashToScalar(challenge_input, label)

   *  AppendScalar: This function adds a scalar representation to the
      transcript.

   *  AppendElement: This function adds an element representation to the
      transcript.

   *  Constrain: This function applies an explicit constraint to the
      proof, where the constraint is expressed as equality between some

      scalars a, b, and elements X, Y, Z.

   *  Verify: This function applies the Fiat-Shamir heuristic to verify
      the zero-knowledge proof.

      raise InvalidVariableAllocationError
    for (_, element_var) in linear_combination:

6.  Ciphersuites

   A ciphersuite (also referred to as 'suite' in this document) for the
   protocol wraps the functionality required for the protocol to take
   place.  The ciphersuite should be available to both the client and
   server, and agreement on the specific instantiation is assumed
   throughout.

   A ciphersuite contains an instantiation of the following
   functionality:

   *  Group: A prime-order Group exposing the API detailed in
      Section 3.1, with the generator element defined in the
      corresponding reference for each group.  Each group also specifies
      HashToGroup, HashToScalar, and serialization functionalities.  For
      HashToGroup, the domain separation tag (DST) is constructed in
      accordance with the recommendations in
      [I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve], Section 3.1.  For HashToScalar,
      each group specifies an integer order that is used in reducing
      integer values to a member of the corresponding scalar field.

   This section includes an initial set of ciphersuites with supported
   groups.  It also includes implementation details for each
   ciphersuite, focusing on input validation.

6.1.  ARC(P-256)

   This ciphersuite uses P-256 [NISTCurves] for the Group.  The value of
   the ciphersuite identifier is "P256".  The value of contextString is
   "ARCV1-P256".

   *  Group: P-256 (secp256r1) [NISTCurves]

      -  Order(): Return 0xffffffff00000000ffffffffffffffffbce6faada7179
         e84f3b9cac2fc632551.

      -  Identity(): As defined in [NISTCurves].

      -  Generator(): As defined in [NISTCurves].

      -  RandomScalar(): Implemented by returning a uniformly random
         Scalar in the range [0, G.Order() - 1].  Refer to Section 6.3
         for implementation guidance.

      -  HashToGroup(x, info): Use hash_to_curve with suite
         P256_XMD:SHA-256_SSWU_RO_ [I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve], input
         x, and DST = "HashToGroup-" || contextString || info.

      -  HashToScalar(x, info): Use hash_to_field from
         [I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve] using L = 48, expand_message_xmd
         with SHA-256, input x and DST = "HashToScalar-" ||
         contextString || info, and prime modulus equal to
         Group.Order().

      -  ScalarInverse(s): Returns the multiplicative inverse of input
         Scalar s mod Group.Order().

      -  SerializeElement(A): Implemented using the compressed Elliptic-
         Curve-Point-to-Octet-String method according to [SEC1]; Ne =
         33.

      -  DeserializeElement(buf): Implemented by attempting to
         deserialize a 33-byte array to a public key using the
         compressed Octet-String-to-Elliptic-Curve-Point method
         according to [SEC1], and then performs partial public-key
         validation as defined in section 5.6.2.3.4 of [KEYAGREEMENT].
         This includes checking that the coordinates of the resulting
         point are in the correct range, that the point is on the curve,
         and that the point is not the point at infinity.  Additionally,
         this function validates that the resulting element is not the
         group identity element.  If these checks fail, deserialization
         returns an InputValidationError error.

      -  SerializeScalar(s): Implemented using the Field-Element-to-
         Octet-String conversion according to [SEC1]; Ns = 32.

      -  DeserializeScalar(buf): Implemented by attempting to
         deserialize a Scalar from a 32-byte string using Octet-String-
         to-Field-Element from [SEC1].  This function can fail if the
         input does not represent a Scalar in the range [0, G.Order() -
         1].

6.2.  ARC(P-384)

   This ciphersuite uses P-384 [NISTCurves] for the Group.  The value of
   the ciphersuite identifier is "P384".  The value of contextString is
   "ARCV1-P384".

   *  Group: P-384 (secp384r1) [NISTCurves]

      -  Order(): Return 0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
         fffc7634d81f4372ddf581a0db248b0a77aecec196accc52973.

      -  Identity(): As defined in [NISTCurves].

      -  Generator(): As defined in [NISTCurves].

      -  RandomScalar(): Implemented by returning a uniformly random
         Scalar in the range [0, G.Order() - 1].  Refer to Section 6.3
         for implementation guidance.

      -  HashToGroup(x, info): Use hash_to_curve with suite
         P384_XMD:SHA-384_SSWU_RO_ [I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve], input
         x, and DST = "HashToGroup-" || contextString || info.

      -  HashToScalar(x, info): Use hash_to_field from
         [I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve] using L = 72, expand_message_xmd
         with SHA-384, input x and DST = "HashToScalar-" ||
         contextString || info, and prime modulus equal to
         Group.Order().

      -  ScalarInverse(s): Returns the multiplicative inverse of input
         Scalar s mod Group.Order().

      -  SerializeElement(A): Implemented using the compressed Elliptic-
         Curve-Point-to-Octet-String method according to [SEC1]; Ne =
         49.

      -  DeserializeElement(buf): Implemented by attempting to
         deserialize a 49-byte array to a public key using the
         compressed Octet-String-to-Elliptic-Curve-Point method
         according to [SEC1], and then performs partial public-key
         validation as defined in section 5.6.2.3.4 of [KEYAGREEMENT].
         This includes checking that the coordinates of the resulting
         point are in the correct range, that the point is on the curve,
         and that the point is not the point at infinity.  Additionally,
         this function validates that the resulting element is not the
         group identity element.  If these checks fail, deserialization
         returns an InputValidationError error.

      -  SerializeScalar(s): Implemented using the Field-Element-to-
         Octet-String conversion according to [SEC1]; Ns = 48.

      -  DeserializeScalar(buf): Implemented by attempting to
         deserialize a Scalar from a 48-byte string using Octet-String-
         to-Field-Element from [SEC1].  This function can fail if the
         input does not represent a Scalar in the range [0, G.Order() -
         1].

6.3.  Random Scalar Generation

   Two popular algorithms for generating a random integer uniformly
   distributed in the range [0, G.Order() -1] are as follows:

6.3.1.  Rejection Sampling

   Generate a random byte array with Ns bytes, and attempt to map to a
   Scalar by calling DeserializeScalar in constant time.  If it
   succeeds, return the result.  If it fails, try again with another
   random byte array, until the procedure succeeds.  Failure to
   implement DeserializeScalar in constant time can leak information
   about the underlying corresponding Scalar.

   As an optimization, if the group order is very close to a power of 2,
   it is acceptable to omit the rejection test completely.  In
   particular, if the group order is p, and there is an integer b such
   that |p - 2^b| is less than 2^(b/2), then RandomScalar can simply
   return a uniformly random integer of at most b bits.

6.3.2.  Random Number Generation Using Extra Random Bits

   Generate a random byte array with L = ceil(((3 *
   ceil(log2(G.Order()))) / 2) / 8) bytes, and interpret it as an
   integer; reduce the integer modulo G.Order() and return the result.
   See [I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve], Section 5 for the underlying
   derivation of L.

7.  Security Considerations

   For arguments about correctness, unforgeability, anonymity, and blind
   issuance of the ARC protocol, see the "Formal Security Definitions
   for Keyed-Verification Anonymous Credentials" in [KVAC].

   This section elaborates on unlinkability properties for ARC and other
   implementation details necessary for these properties to hold.

7.1.  Credential Issuance Unlinkability

   Client credential requests are constructed such that the server
   cannot distinguish between any two credential requests from the same
   client and two requests from different clients.  We refer to this
   property as issuance unlinkability.  This property is achieved by the
   way the credential requests are constructed.  In particular, each
   credential request consists of two Pedersen commitments with fresh
   blinding factors, which are used to commit to a freshly generated
   client secret and request context.  The resulting request is
   therefore perfectly hiding, and independent from other requests from
   the same client.  More details about this unlinkability property can
   be found in [KVAC] and [REVISITING_KVAC].

7.2.  Presentation Unlinkability

   Client credential presentations are constructed so that all
   presentations are indistinguishable, even if coming from the same
   user.  We refer to this property as presentation unlinkability.  This
   property is achieved by the way the credential presentations are
   constructed.  The presentation elements [U, UPrimeCommit, m1Commit]
   are indistinguishable from all other presentations made from
   credentials issued with the same server keys, as detailed in [KVAC].

   The indistinguishability set for these presentation elements is
   sum_{i=0}^c(p_i), where c is the number of credentials issued with
   the same server keys, and p_i is the number of presentations made for
   each of those credentials.

   The presentation elements [tag, nonce, presentationContext,
   presentationProof] are indistinguishable from all presentations made
   from credentials issued with the same server keys for that
   presentationContext, with the exception of presentations with the
   same nonce (since those presentations can be ascertained as being
   generated from different credentials, as long as the presentation tag
   is unique).

   The indistinguishability set for those presentation elements is
   sum_{i=0}^c(p_i[presentationContext]) - k[presentationContext], where
   c is the number of credentials issued with the same server keys,
   p_i[presentationContext] is the number of presentations made for each
   of those credentials with the same presentationContext, and k is the
   number of presentations with the same nonce for that
   presentationContext.  As long as the nonces are generated randomly
   from the range defined by the presentation limit,
   k[presentationContext] should be roughly equal to
   sum_{i=0}^c(p_i[presentationContext]) / n, where n is the
   presentation limit.  Therefore, the indistinguishability set can be
   represented as sum_{i=0}^c(p_i[presentationContext])(1 - 1/n), where
   a larger presentation limit results in a larger indistinguishability
   set and therefore stronger unlinkability properties.

   [[OPEN ISSUE: hide the nonce and replace the tag proof with a range
   proof built from something like Bulletproofs.]]

7.3.  Timing Leaks

   To ensure no information is leaked during protocol execution, all
   operations that use secret data MUST run in constant time.  This
   includes all prime-order group operations and proof-specific
   operations that operate on secret data, including proof generation
   and verification.

8.  Alternatives considered

   ARC uses the MACGGM algebraic MAC as its underlying primitive, as
   detailed in [KVAC] and [REVISITING_KVAC].  This offers the benefit of
   having a lower credential size than MACDDH, which is an alternative
   algebraic MAC detailed in [KVAC].

   The BBS anonymous credential scheme, as detailed in [BBS] and its
   variants, is efficient and publicly verifiable, but requires pairings
   for verification.  This is problematic for adoption because pairings
   are not supported as widely in software and hardware as non-pairing
   elliptic curves.

   It is possible to construct a keyed-verification variant of BBS which
   doesn't use pairings, as discussed in [BBDT17] and [REVISITING_KVAC].
   However these keyed-verification BBS variants require more analysis,
   proofs of security properties, and review to be considered mature
   enough for safe deployment.
