Updated the proof of concept accordingly.\r\n- Changed the proof of concept presentationState to have nonces start at 0 (instead of 1)\r\n-  Tightened the presentation limit bounds to 0 <= nonce < rateLimit (was previously allowing for nonce = rateLimit)\r\n\r\nFixes:\r\n- Added `x2` to the ServerKey test vectors (previously had a typo, repeated `x1` twice).\r\n\r\nSome things I have questions about:\r\n- Why aren't the presentation proof statements (5.4) rendering correctly? I don't see anything that should result in a formatting error, but the markdown seems unhappy with the Tag definition.",

So if we can have it just be the issuer name, that would be ideal (allows for more flexibility upon presentation).\r\n2. By \"challenge extension\" you mean another field in the TokenChallenge sent from the Client Origin? I had been thinking that the rate limit gets sent with the server public keys - so that can be in the TokenChallenge itself, or alongside it.\r\n   - Though looking through the origin-provided inputs, I see that the Privacy Pass spec has the origin sending the Public Key ID (issuer_key_id), instead of the public key itself. Since the client needs the full public key for the FinalizeCredential call, when does it receive the full public key? Or is this step considered to be out-of-band and not defined by the spec?\r\n3.

      "body": "Cleanup / documentation tasks:\r\n- Some proof documentation was incorrect - specifically, the comments for statements 5a and 5b in the response proof were in the wrong order. \r\n- Added request_context to the test vectors, so we can test that request_context gets hashed correctly to become m2. \r\n\r\nPotential additional tasks: \r\n- Currently, the ProofParticipant initializer ignores the input label, instead setting it to an empty string. We should actually use the label, to differentiate different proofs. However, I didn't make that change in this PR because it changes all the proof test vectors, which would be quite disruptive. Maybe this fix can get rolled into the next change the significantly alters the test vectors.",
